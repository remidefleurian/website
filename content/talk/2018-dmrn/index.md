abstract = "Little is known about the effects of stimulus-driven properties, stylistic preference, and familiarity on the occurrence of musical chills. In the present study, participants listened to 12 unfamiliar songs in liked and disliked musical genres. Half were taken from a dataset of songs previously reported as causing chills, while the other half were matched with these songs by artist and popularity. Objective measurements of piloerection and continuous self-reports of the occurrence of chills and intensely pleasurable moments were taken in two lab sessions, separated by a two-week longitudinal phase during which participants listened to the full set of songs another eight times. Preliminary results taken from the first lab session are discussed, in terms of occurrence of chills and intensely pleasurable moments across all conditions."

## About

{{< figure class="avatar" src="/img/avatar.jpg" >}}

I am a final year PhD candidate in the [Music Cognition Lab](http://music-cognition.eecs.qmul.ac.uk/), part of the [Cognitive Science Research Group](http://cogsci.eecs.qmul.ac.uk/) at Queen Mary University of London. 
I am researching the effects of expectation[^1] on chills[^2] experienced in response to music listening with [Marcus Pearce](http://webprojects.eecs.qmul.ac.uk/marcusp/) and [Emmanouil Benetos](http://www.eecs.qmul.ac.uk/~emmanouilb/), using behavioral, physiological, and computational methods. 
I am interested in music cognition, empirical aesthetics, data science, data vizualisation, and open science.

I also recently joined Spotify New York as a Data Scientist, working on recommendations within the Personalization team. You can reach me by [email](mailto:remi.defleurian@gmail.com),

[^1]: Musical expectation follows a process of probabilistic prediction of the statistical regularities in musical structure, which allows expectations learned through musical enculturation to be violated, delayed, or confirmed when listening to music, resulting in induced emotions [[ref](https://doi.org/10.1111/nyas.13654)]
[^2]: Chills are a fleeting, pleasurable bodily sensation, sometimes accompanied by goosebumps, experienced when listening to specific musical passages [[ref](https://doi.org/10.31234/osf.io/yc6d8)]

## About

{{< figure class="avatar" src="/img/avatar.jpg" >}}

I am a final year PhD candidate in the [Music Cognition Lab](http://music-cognition.eecs.qmul.ac.uk/), part of the [Cognitive Science Research Group](http://cogsci.eecs.qmul.ac.uk/) at Queen Mary University of London. 
I am researching the effects of expectation[^1] on chills[^2] experienced in response to music listening, using behavioral, physiological, and computational methods, with [Marcus Pearce](http://webprojects.eecs.qmul.ac.uk/marcusp/) and [Emmanouil Benetos](http://www.eecs.qmul.ac.uk/~emmanouilb/). 
I am interested in music cognition, empirical aesthetics, data science, data vizualisation, and open science.

I currently live in Brooklyn, NY.

[^1]: Musical expectation follows a process of probabilistic prediction of the statistical regularities in musical structure, which allows expectations learned through musical enculturation to be violated, delayed, or confirmed when listening to music, resulting in induced emotions [[ref](https://doi.org/10.1111/nyas.13654)]
[^2]: Chills are a ﬂeeting, pleasurable bodily sensation, sometimes accompanied by goosebumps, experienced when listening to speciﬁc musical passages [[ref](https://doi.org/10.31234/osf.io/yc6d8)]

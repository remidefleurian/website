abstract = "The present project aims to use two hypothesised underlying mechanisms of emotional responses to music—brain stem reﬂexes and musical expectancy—as predictors of aesthetic experiences, by focusing on chills as indicators of such experiences. Current evidence suggests individual associations between brain stem reﬂexes, musical expectancy, chills, affective response, and aesthetic response, but there remain some missing links to theories advanced in the early days of the empirical aesthetics of music. Recent tools, such as music information retrieval or probabilistic models of expectation, have made the investigation of these missing links possible. The proposed research seeks to use these tools to gather information about the speciﬁc timing of chills in music, to understand how consistent chills responses are developed over time, to use acoustic and structural properties to predict and manipulate pleasurable moments in music, and to tease apart the effects of schematic and veridical expectancy on the aesthetic response to music."

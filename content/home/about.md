# Biography

I am a PhD candidate in the [Music Cognition Lab](http://music-cognition.eecs.qmul.ac.uk/), part of the [Cognitive Science Research Group](http://cogsci.eecs.qmul.ac.uk/) at QMUL. My research aims to better understand why we enjoy listening to music, by attempting to predict the occurrence of pleasurable moments in music, using behavioural, physiological, and computational methods. I am particularly interested in the effects of expectancy on aesthetic responses.

I am the recipient of an [EPSRC](https://epsrc.ukri.org/) + [AHRC](https://ahrc.ukri.org/) studentship provided by the [Centre for Doctoral Training in Media and Arts Technology](http://www.mat.qmul.ac.uk/) to conduct my research under the supervision of [Dr Marcus Pearce](http://webprojects.eecs.qmul.ac.uk/marcusp/) and [Dr Emmanouil Benetos](http://www.eecs.qmul.ac.uk/~emmanouilb/).
